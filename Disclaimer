This guide to Visual3D represents a synthesis of information from the Visual3D wiki (https://www.c-motion.com/v3dwiki/index.php?title=Main_Page),
former collegues, as well as myself. It is intended to be used as a teaching tool to help facilitate learning in those who have access to Visual3D software.
